# Crops Display Fix - Complete ✅

## Problem

Vinay's crops were showing as "N/A" in the Streamlit dashboard even though he completed the comprehensive onboarding with crop information.

## Root Cause

**Data Format Mismatch:**

**Old Onboarding Format (4 questions):**
```json
{
  "crops": "wheat, rice, cotton"
}
```

**New Comprehensive Onboarding Format (11 questions):**
```json
{
  "current_crops": "sugarcane",
  "past_crops": "Rice, wheat, soyabean, turmeric, sugarcane, tur daal"
}
```

**Streamlit Dashboard:**
- Was only looking for `crops` field
- Didn't check `current_crops` or `past_crops`
- Resulted in "N/A" for all new users

## Vinay's Actual Data

From DynamoDB:
```json
{
  "name": "Vinay",
  "village": "Bamani",
  "district": "Kolhapur",
  "land_acres": "50",
  "soil_type": "Black Cotton Soil",
  "water_source": "Drip Irrigation",
  "current_crops": "sugarcane",
  "past_crops": "Rice, wheat, soyabean, turmeric, sugarcane, tur daal",
  "experience": "15",
  "challenges": "Pests and disease",
  "goals": "..."
}
```

## Solution

Updated Streamlit dashboard to handle both formats:

```python
# Get crops - handle both old and new onboarding formats
crops = user.get('crops', None)  # Old format
if not crops or crops == 'N/A':
    # New comprehensive onboarding format
    current_crops = user.get('current_crops', '')
    past_crops = user.get('past_crops', '')
    if current_crops:
        crops = current_crops
    elif past_crops:
        # Take first 3 crops from past crops
        past_list = [c.strip() for c in past_crops.split(',')][:3]
        crops = ', '.join(past_list)
    else:
        crops = 'N/A'
```

## Logic

1. **First:** Check for `crops` field (old format)
2. **If not found:** Check `current_crops` (new format - preferred)
3. **If not found:** Use first 3 from `past_crops` (new format - fallback)
4. **If none:** Show "N/A"

## Result

**Before:**
```
Name: Vinay
Village: Bamani
Crops: N/A  ❌
```

**After:**
```
Name: Vinay
Village: Bamani
Crops: sugarcane  ✅
```

Or if no current crops:
```
Crops: Rice, wheat, soyabean  ✅
```

## Backward Compatibility

✅ **Old Format Users:** Still works (checks `crops` field first)
✅ **New Format Users:** Now works (checks `current_crops` and `past_crops`)
✅ **Demo Users:** Still works (uses `crops_grown` field)

## Files Modified

- `dashboard/streamlit_app.py` - Updated farmer data loading logic

## Testing

### Test with Vinay's Profile
```bash
# Check DynamoDB
aws dynamodb get-item \
  --table-name kisaanmitra-farmer-profiles \
  --key '{"user_id": {"S": "918788868929"}}' \
  --region ap-south-1

# View in Streamlit
streamlit run dashboard/streamlit_app.py
# Navigate to "👥 Farmers" tab
# Search for "Vinay"
# Should show: Crops: sugarcane ✅
```

## Status: FIXED ✅

The Streamlit dashboard now correctly displays crops for users who completed the new comprehensive 11-question onboarding!

Vinay's crops will now show as "sugarcane" instead of "N/A".
